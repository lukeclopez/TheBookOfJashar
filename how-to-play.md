Balance battlefield strategy with the spirituality of your tribe to conquer the promised land. To help you do this, make wise use of your Levites, lots, and soldiers.

### How to Set Up



### How to Take Your Turn

#### 1. Assign Your Levites

Each of your Levites can do one of the following actions on this turn:

##### Teach the Law

Any Levite given this assignment will be ready to satisfy the spiritual hunger of the people in case it arises (if a 7 is rolled).

##### Sing Praises

Any Levite given this assignment will raise the morale of the troops in the field, making them more effective.

##### Pray for Spirituality

Any Levite given this assignment will aid your progress in receiving a spiritual blessing.

##### Pray for Conquest

Any Levite given this assignment will aid your progress in receiving a conquest blessing.

##### Seek Direction

Any Levite given this assignment will be ready to receive additional divine direction, should it appear (if a 2 or a 12 is rolled).

##### Update Your Tribe Card!

For every one Levite praying for a conquest blessing or a spiritual blessing, move the target prayer meter up by one.

#### 2. Cast Lots

Cast two lots (dice) and add their numbers together to become aware of events affecting your tribe.

##### Results

###### 2

Divine insight has come through the prophets. Do you have at least one Levite seeking direction to receive this direction?

###### 3

Something happened! Draw an event card to see what it was.

###### 4

Nothing

###### 5

Nothing

###### 6

Nothing

###### 7

Your tribe is spiritually hungry. Are your Levites there to teach them the Law, or will they result to idolatry?

The smaller number of the two dice you rolled represents the amount of spiritual hunger your tribe has on this turn. The number of Levites you have teaching the Law will satisfy that hunger. Unsatisfied spiritual hunger detracts from your faith.

Example: I rolled a 3 and a 4, which equals 7. The smaller number is 3. I have 2 Levites teaching the law.
Iâ€™ve only satisfied 2/3 of the spiritual hunger my tribe has, so my faith meter decreases by 1.

###### 8

Nothing

###### 9

Nothing

###### 10

Nothing

###### 11

Something happened! Draw an event card to see what it was.

###### 12

Divine insight has come through the prophets. Do you have at least one Levite seeking direction to receive this direction?

##### Update Your Tribe Card!

Your faith meter should be updated if there was spiritual hunger (you rolled a 7).

### 3. Move Soldiers

Move each soldier up to 3 spaces in any direction.
* If a soldier can reach a city during the turn, he can start attacking it in the same turn.
* Two soldiers cannot occupy the same space.

### 4. Keep Time

Your soldiers are making progress in their conquest!

For every ongoing battle, remove one time counter per attacking soldier.

### Battles

As long as the tribe is faithful (the faith meter is halfway full or more), your soldiers will win! Each soldier will remove one time counter per turn.

If your tribe is unfaithful (the faith meter is less than halfway full), your soldiers will not be able to make any progress (No time counters will be removed)

### Events and Direction

Event cards and direction cards come with their own instructions. You'll know what to do!

### Cooperative Mode

Everyone at the table has 20 turns to conquer the allotted cities. If any cities remain, everyone loses. If no cities remain, everyone wins.

### Competitive Mode

When all the allotted cities are conquered, the game ends. Whoever has the most victory points wins.
