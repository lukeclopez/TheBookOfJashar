        <p>The prophets have revealed that a bad event will come in the future. Teach the law on your next turn and you (or all tribes, if you so choose) will be exempt from its consequences. After teaching the law, keep this card until a bad event occurs, then decide whether to use this card to avoid it or not.</p>
