Balance battlefield strategy with the spirituality of your tribe to conquer the promised land. To help you do this, make wise use of your Levites, lots, and soldiers.

### How to Set Up

1. Every player chooses a tribe.
   1. Depending on the tribe, each player will get a different number of soldiers and Levites.
      1. Judah: 6 Soldiers, 4 Levites
      2. Naphtali: 5 Soldiers, 5 Levites
      3. Zebulun: 5 Soldiers, 5 Levites
      4. Gad: 4 Soldiers, 6 Levites
2. Shuffle the city cards and draw ten. These are the cities available for conquest.
   1. For each city, place a city marker on the map to make it easy to find.
3. Deal three city cards (NOT from the conquest city cards) to each player. These are their starting locations.
4. Each player takes one turn to place all his soldiers on the map.
   1. The player divides their soldiers up between their three potential starting cities as desired.
   2. If a tile is already taken, the player can place a soldier on an immediately adjacent title.
5. Once all the soldiers are placed, normal turns begin!

### How to Take Your Turn

#### 1. Assign Your Levites

Each of your Levites can do one of the following actions on this turn:

##### Teach the Law

Any Levite given this assignment will be ready to satisfy the spiritual hunger of the people in case it arises (see "Cast Lots" below).

##### Sing Praises

Any Levite given this assignment will raise the morale of the troops in the field, making them more effective.

One Levite singing praises has the same effect as one soldier fighting in a battle. When you keep score at the end of your turn, you can decide in which battle you want to score the extra points.

##### Pray for Direction and Blessings

Any Levite given this assignment will aid your progress in receiving a blessing.

One Levite praying for a blessing will increase the prayer meter by one each turn.

Once the prayer meter is maxed out, the player may choose a random blessing card from either the Conquest Blessings or the Spiritual Blessings. Then, the meter is reset to the beginning.

If you have at least one Levite praying when direction appears (see "Cast Lots" below), you draw a "Direction" card and follow the instructions on it.

#### 2. Cast Lots

Cast two lots (dice) and add their numbers together to become aware of events affecting your tribe.

##### Results

###### 2

If you have at least one Levite praying, your tribe receives divine direction.

###### 3

Something happened! Draw an event card to see what it was.

###### 4

Nothing

###### 5

Nothing

###### 6

Your tribe is spiritually hungry. Are your Levites there to teach them the Law, or will they result to idolatry?

The smaller number of the two dice you rolled represents the amount of spiritual hunger your tribe has on this turn. The number of Levites you have teaching the Law will satisfy that hunger. Unsatisfied spiritual hunger detracts from your faith.

Example: I rolled a 3 and a 4, which equals 7. The smaller number is 3. I have 2 Levites teaching the law.
Iâ€™ve only satisfied 2/3 of the spiritual hunger my tribe has, so my faith meter decreases by 1.

###### 7

Your tribe is spiritually hungry. (See description for 6)

###### 8

Nothing

###### 9

Nothing

###### 10

Nothing

###### 11

Something happened! Draw an event card to see what it was.

###### 12

If you have at least one Levite praying, your tribe receives divine direction.

##### Update Your Tribe Card!

Your faith meter should be updated if there was spiritual hunger.

### 3. Move Soldiers

Move each soldier up to 3 spaces in any direction.

- If a soldier can reach a city during the turn, he can start attacking it in the same turn.
- Soldiers from different tribes can join in an ongoing battle in cooperative mode, but not in competitive mode.
- A soldier cannot end his turn in the same space as another soldier, UNLESS they are joining an ongoing battle.

### 4. Keep Score (Count your points)

Your soldiers are making progress in their conquest!

For every ongoing battle, count one point per attacking soldier

### Battles

Each city card has a "Power" number showing how many points you must score in the city to conquer it. If that number is 10, you can score a maximum of 10 points in that city to conquer it.

As long as the tribe is faithful (the faith meter is halfway full or more), your soldiers will win! Each soldier attacking the city will score one point per turn until you have "taken" all the points from that city. At that point, the city is conquered.

If your tribe is unfaithful (the faith meter is less than halfway full), your soldiers will not be able to make any progress (No points will be scored).

On the turn when you start a battle, write down the name of the city, it's power, and score one point against the city.

### Events and Direction

Event cards and direction cards come with their own instructions. You'll know what to do!

### Cooperative Mode

Everyone at the table has 20 turns to conquer the allotted cities. If any cities remain, everyone loses. If no cities remain, everyone wins.

### Competitive Mode

When all the allotted cities are conquered, the game ends. Whoever has the most victory points wins.
